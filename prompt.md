write me a report in markdown, detailing the entirety of my datamining project,
collect data using arctic shift 
combine to 2 parquet files
EDA (in the eda/ directory)
Sentiment analysis(inital plan) : run Roberta models (but needs to fine tune in order to present the typical processing pipeline -> needs label -> too much effort for too little rewards -> decided against)
Topic Modeling: Integration(combine into 1 parquet file) -> search from that parquet file -> K-mean cluster -> artifacts
