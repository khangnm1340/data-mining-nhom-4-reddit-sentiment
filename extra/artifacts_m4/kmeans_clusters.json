Looking to purchase first gaming laptop\nStruggle: I've only ever personally owned two laptops, one with 8gb ram the other with 12gb ram, and they both had some GPU that I couldn't even really find any real reviews of on the internet. I've never had a desktop/PC (unsure of wording here). I find it very hard to understand the performance difference of these two sales I found an internal discount program I have access to.\n\nIntended usage: I'm entering the software industry; I recently got at a job where I'm able to use a MacBook M4 Pro work laptop with a 20 core GPU that has 48gb ram and was really surprised by the difference. I regularly push beyond 32gb for work - a lot of it is due to working on various projects locally in parallel and having a billion wiki tabs open for them - but I don't really plan to work on that many concurrent projects on a personal laptop. I do want to play some eye candy games, though, and I also want to watch some documentaries or movies on high res. I do go around a lot so portability is a nice to have, and I don't have a docking station at home and don't plan on having one.\n\nTLDR: No clue what the real difference between these two laptops are, want to do software dev and play eye candy games and watch movies/documentaries, what to get & are these good deals??  \n\n\n"

          "body": "Macbook Air M4 to Macbook Pro M4 - are these reasons worth it?\nHi!\n\n**tl;dr** \\- Is the Macbook Pro M4 worth it over Macbook Air M4 when it comes to screen (deeper blacks and HDR, for light editing photos/videos and watching) and speakers (more bass/surround) vs. the size/weight trade-off? Or the Macbook Air M4's screen and speakers are good enough already given with the advantage of the size/weight than the Macbook Pro M4? My situation is below.\n\nI know I'll get biased answers here and this is something that I can answer to myself or know the answer already but a little help from this sub is better I believe even though there are multiple discussion/posts/videos about it.\n\nSo I posted last week in r/macbookair and eventually went with Macbook Air M4 (16GB + 512GB) and I got it in a good price that I can re-sell it (although it might take some time) and can earn around $140-160. My reason are that it's cheaper, lighter/portable (around 300g/less beefy than Pro) so I can bring it easily inside or outside the house, I'll do more browsing/productivity, occasional light photo or video editing and I'm planning to upgrade my Mac Mini M1 (16GB + 512GB) in the near future plus upgrading my monitor to an OLED Gaming Monitor (27\" 1440p 165Hz+).\n\nIt's my first personal laptop in 12 years and I'm happy with it especially when it comes to screen, speaker and size/weight. I've been using more often than my PC (Ryzen 7 5800x + 7800XT + 64GB) since I'm more into browsing and watching YouTube rather than playing (Dota 2) as it's more convenient to open the Macbook just to browse and watch YouTube than opening the PC and not only that, it'll much cheaper when it comes to electricity consumption since my PC would generate already around 200-250W given with the specs and what I'll be doing outside of gaming. \n\nHere comes my late realization, I thought I won't be using it that much and will only use it only occasionally but it became my main computer now given on my use case so I've been reading and searching between \"Macbook Air vs Pro M4\" lately for few days now and even post my Macbook Air M4 to check interest and I can sell it then I'll go with Macbook Pro M4.\n\nSo now, these are my questions/reasons (+/-) if it's worth it to get the Macbook Pro M4:\n\n* **Screen (+)** \\- I'm happy with the screen of Macbook Air M4 and I don't mind the screen size (13\") of it so upgrading it to 14\" is just a bonus but I'm wondering if the Liquid Retina XDR are worth it? I'm happy with the quality of the screen of Macbook Air M4 but I'm quite somehow sucker when it comes time to display/screen. I don't mind the refresh rate since it only matters to me when it comes to gaming. I have a 65\" TV although not an OLED (just an IPS) but it's a decent TV (LG SM9000) for me if I wanted to watch some videos (Movies/Series from Streaming Platform or Offline Files, YouTube) however the convenience on Macbook changed it\n* **Speaker** **(+)** \\- I'm surprised as well how good the speakers on Macbook Air M4 which makes me think if the speakers on Macbook Pro M4 are worth it. It seems the consensus is that, its good already and better than 90% of the laptop in the market but the speakers on Macbook Pro M4 are better (I'm not sure how much in real world experience) which I have yet to try in store though I don't have yet time now to do so. I have multiple audio sources (Polk Audio S15, Wharfedale 12.1, Swans M50W, Edifier R1380DB) if I really wanted to have a better sounds however again, the convenience on Macbook changed it\n* **Size/Weight (-)** \\- This is what made me fell in love with Macbook Air M4, the size and weight. I'm moving within our house (small) between living room, bedroom or kitchen once in a while so I don't think the size/weight will matter though I'm not sure if it's on my lap (if I'm in bed). For traveling, I only do around 2-4 per year when it comes to leisure travel (domestic or international) and my plan moving forward is to bring my Macbook Air M4 together with my camera/s (Fujifilm X100VI but planning to add Fujifilm X-T5) and/or lenses (Fujifilm 14mm f/2.8 and/or Fujifilm 35mm f/1.4 - I don't have it yet but what I'm planning to get). I'm not a big and strong guy so the 300g+ and the more beefy of Macbook M4 Pro will matter a bit but I'm not sure if it's big deal. What I plan is I'll leave it the accommodation. For moving within or outside the city, I'm planning to bring it once in a while through commuting (more often) or driving.\n\nHope you can still help me (even though I should be the one able to answer this) to decide and unfortunately, not an option to buy the Macbook Pro M4 and then compare it since I'm eyeing for a used one (with Apple Care+ Warranty until 2028) or just go YOLO and buy it and worry later which one to sell but this one is quite impractical and risky.\n\nThank you."

However, it's driving me nuts as it's always just slipping off.\n\nAre there any negatives to using a USBC to power instead of the magsafe, besides the fall risk?\n\nI apologise if its a very stupid question, I'm just not in a financial position to slowly ruin a new Macbook if it somehow damages the laptop long term. Like, maybe the USBC cords can power it but you shouldn't for a technical reason I don't know about?\n\nI appreciate the help and if this is a facepalm moment, I appreciate your patience.

Same logic as before, eyes focusing on moving object -> relative to eyes moving object is stationary = shadows are moving relative to the eyes.  \nThey are visible no matter the display brightness, or external light setting.   \nIf those horizontal bright lights are backlights, then the whatever layer is responsible for dissipation is warped/wavy.   \nVertical shadows look like pixels lost their will to work in this economy.  \n  \n**Tasks this laptop is used for:**  \n4K, 8K MP4 and RAW video editing in Final Cut, exporting to h264, h265, sometimes small clips to RAW.   \n4k, 8k photo editing/corrections, sometimes \"Topaz Photos ai\" for upscaling, denoising etc.   \nFFMPEG recoding.  \nLogic Pro (insignificant load).  \nVSCode/Xcode (insignificant load).  \n  \n**CPU/GPU Temperatures:**  \nSimple Web browsing/writing this post 40C¬∫/50C¬∫  \nFans usually kick in at around 70C¬∫  \nDuring high load, CPU and GPU cores are at around 85C¬∫/103C¬∫\n\n**Dropped? Water spill? Some Other Damage?**  \nNope, never spilled any liquids, never dropped, never stabbed, never sat on...you get it.\n\n**Nano Texture Care:**  \nAlways used the cloth included in the box, never made the cloth or screen damp/wet, never sprayed any other screen cleaning things. Just dusted off with a compressor and wiped anything that was on there.   \nWhen screen is turned off and held up to the light - no visible bents, dents, marks, lards...no scratches.  \nBack side of the display panel is flat, ie no bends/dents.\n\n  \nAnyone seen this kind of issue? \n\nPersonally, after searching the whole of reddit and the rest of the internet, I didn't find any instances of similar damage to MacBooks, at least not the M4 models.   \n  \nTo me, looks like heat damage from the fan exhaust, as these vertical shadows on the left and right are right in front of these main exhausts. There is a middle one too, but it's not really for that main hot air. Half of the air still leaves through the bottom exhausts which are never blocked by anything btw, during high load laptop back feet are pried up on something, like bottle caps lol. \n\nThank God for that AppleCare+, otherwise it would be a ¬£1000+ screen replacement. This way it will be ¬£250 max or something, unless Apple \"Genius\" Bar will work something out in their favor as they like to do with repairs. \n\nOn a similar note, when i first started using this mac, i noticed slight shadowing on all the 4 corners of the screen, sides too just a bit. Thought it was software thing that Apple did to the UI. Apparently its a problem that is quite wide, but not warranted...  \n  \nGonna call that Apple support, describe my problem and see what they say.   \nWill make an appointment with an Apple store next week too, coz this is bugging my eyes just too much.\n\nWill be updating this post until the problem is resolved."

I've also purchased AppleCare+, but it doesn't cover cosmetic damage such as worn out keycaps and scratches.\n\nI've been researching all over the internet. I know the usual recommendations are to not use any protective accessories like hard shells, keyboard covers, and screen protectors, as they can damage the hinge and screen. The way to go seems to be keeping the screen and keyboard clean.\n\nHowever, I use my laptop a lot and I want to be comfortable with it. I'm sometimes clumsy too. I much prefer putting these accessories than having to focus on cleaning it all the time. Since AppleCare+ only kicks in when something breaks, isn't it logical to use the accessories to prevent cosmetic damage and just have it repaired if something breaks?\n\nAlso, any recommendations for hard shells and screen protectors for 2024 MacBook M4 Max?"

Is the **Mac mini + PC combo better** long-term than buying a **MacBook M4 (13\")** directly now?\n2. Since I already have a decent laptop for light/portable tasks, is it smart to **skip the MacBook M4** and wait for a better MacBook Pro?\n3. Will this **dual-device setup** (PC + Mac mini) offer **more flexibility and value** for a dev/student, or is it unnecessary?\n4.
