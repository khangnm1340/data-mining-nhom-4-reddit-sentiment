I don't do professional mixing or anything ,just want the best sound experience for enjoying music at my desk and out and about.\n\nOn that note, I'm also in the market for a DAC/amp. My conclusion would be that I'd have two different setups\n\n 1 : A desktop DAC/amp combo , something around the $150-$200 range.\n\n2 : A portable DAC/amp with tactile controls like a button and slider , just for carrying around with my phone. I could maybe go cheaper on this one and focus most of my budget on the desktop setup.\n\n\nWhat I'd like to know from you guys \n\n1: Which headphone model you'd go for and why\n2: DAC/amp suggestions for both desktop and portable\n3: Whether a balanced cable is worth getting now or later\n\nMore info.\nI do not have the opportunity to try out any of them before hand.\n\nMusic , I listen to everything . I do like bass though - I'd likely EQ a bit into that directionsl depending on how I'm feeling \n\nThanks all !"

          "body": "Grell Audio OAE1 Review\n# The OAE1 Deserves Your Attention \n\nNote: This is a shorter version of my review  [Pragmatic Audio](https://www.pragmaticaudio.com/reviews/2025/07/grell-audio-oae1/)\n\nThe OAE1 is probably the most polarizing headphone I've ever reviewed. It's tuned completely differently from anything else on the market, using extreme angled drivers and \"free field\" tuning instead of traditional \"diffuse field\" approaches. After 6 weeks of extensive listening, I think it's genuinely innovative - but definitely not for everyone.\n\n# The Backstory: \"Think Different\" Meets Audio Science\n\nAfter spending many evenings listening too and thinking about the OAE1, two thoughts kept coming to mind from my computer industry background:\n\n1. **Steve Jobs' \"Think Different\" campaign** \\- This headphone challenges conventional headphone tuning in the same way Mac challenged Windows PCs\n2. **The Gartner Hype Cycle** \\- The OAE1's launch perfectly mirrors this: initial buzz → inflated expectations → backlash → and now, hopefully, a more balanced understanding\n\nThe truth is somewhere between the hype and the hate. Like Mac vs PC, this will always be a headphone that people either love or hate.\n\n**The Science Behind the Madness**\n\nTo really appreciate the OAE1, you need to understand why Axel Grell (yes, the same guy who designed the HD600) made such radical design choices:\n\n# 1. Deep Extended Bass Response\n\nUnlike most headphones that have a \"Harman dip\" in the midbass, the OAE1 goes for a more linear, speaker-like bass response. This eliminates the artificial separation that mimics bad room acoustics.\n\n# 2. Free Field vs Diffuse Field Tuning\n\nThis is the big one. Most headphones assume sound comes from all directions equally (diffuse field). The OAE1 assumes sound comes primarily from a 30-degree angle in front of you - like actual speakers in a room.\n\n**What this means in practice:**\n\n* Much more recessed presence region (less \"detail\" in the traditional sense)\n* Soundstage that projects forward instead of wrapping around your head\n* A more \"speaker-like\" presentation overall\n\n**Build Quality & Comfort**\n\n**The Good:**\n\n* Solid mix of metal and plastic construction\n* Unique aesthetic that's love-it-or-hate-it\n* Lightweight at \\~320g\n* Quality detachable cable (though it's 2.5mm to 3.5mm)\n\n**The Not-So-Good:**\n\n* Comfort is hit-or-miss depending on head size\n* Pretty significant clamping force\n* Very deep earpads due to angled drivers\n* If you have a large head, these might be too tight even at max extension\n\nComfort Rating: 5/10 (for me personally - YMMV)\n\n**Sound Impressions: A Different Kind of Audio Experience**\n\nHere's where it gets interesting. The OAE1 doesn't sound like other headphones, and that's entirely the point.\n\n# Bass\n\nDeep, clean, and speaker-like. Not the artificial impact of most headphones, but more like what you'd hear from quality studio monitors with a bass boost. It's tilted but linear - no weird bumps or dips.\n\n**Test Track: \"Misguided Angel\" - Cowboy Junkies** Bass guitar and kick drum sit exactly where they should: supportive and warm, but never dominating. There's excellent separation between low-frequency instruments.\n\n# Midrange\n\nThis is where the OAE1 really shines. Vocals and acoustic instruments have organic clarity and lifelike timbre that I rarely hear in headphones.\n\n**Test Track: \"Blue Ridge Mountains\" - Fleet Foxes** Vocal harmonies are rendered with startling presence and dimensionality. Acoustic guitar strums showcase excellent transient response with rich harmonic nuance.\n\n# Treble\n\nHere's where the controversy starts. The treble is deliberately recessed compared to most headphones. It's refined and non-fatiguing, but will sound \"less detailed\" to people used to conventional headphone tuning.\n\n**Test Track: \"Orphan Girl\" - Emmylou Harris** Treble resolves micro-details without pushing them forward unnaturally. There's airiness that contributes to realism, not artificial brightness.\n\n# Soundstage & Imaging\n\nThe OAE1's defining characteristic. It creates a genuinely out-of-head experience that projects forward like nearfield monitors.\n\n**Test Track: \"Wayfaring Stranger\" - Johnny Cash** Soundstage appears to project forward rather than wrapping around your head. Ambient cues like room reverb are rendered with lifelike depth.\n\n**Measurements & Technical Performance**\n\n**Specs:**\n\n* Driver: Dynamic, front-mounted at extreme angle\n* Impedance: 32 Ohms\n* Sensitivity: 100 dB/mW\n* Easy to drive (works fine with Apple USB-C dongle)\n\n**Key Measurement Notes:**\n\n* The bass is indeed very tilted but linear\n* Presence region is significantly recessed (6-10kHz area)\n* Positioning matters A LOT - small changes in placement dramatically affect FR\n* Distortion is well-controlled for the driver size\n\n# Who Should (and Shouldn't) Consider the OAE1\n\n# Perfect for:\n\n* **Speaker enthusiasts** who find conventional headphones unnatural\n* **Live music lovers** who want that concert hall bass feel\n* **Americana/Roots music fans** \\- seriously, this genre sounds incredible\n* **Audio experimentalists** who appreciate the science behind reproduction\n* **People building headphone collections** who want something truly different\n\n# Probably not for:\n\n* Traditional \"headphone people\" who like conventional presentations\n* Those seeking maximum bass impact and rumble\n* People who prefer intimate, \"in your head\" sound\n* Users with larger heads (comfort issues)\n* Anyone expecting conventional \"detail\" and \"clarity\"\n\n**The Circle of Confusion Problem**\n\nHere's the thing that explains a lot of the mixed reactions: most music is recorded and mastered using conventional headphones and monitors. When you play this music back on the \"more correct\" OAE1, it doesn't always sound as expected.\n\nIt's like the audiophile version of the chicken-and-egg problem. The OAE1 might be more technically correct, but it's swimming against decades of recording conventions.\n\n**EQ Suggestions (For Those Who Want Them)**\n\nWhile the OAE1 is designed with a specific vision, some listeners might want to bridge the gap:\n\n**Simple PEQ Settings:**\n\n* Low Shelf: 100Hz, +2dB, Q=0.7 (more sub-bass impact)\n* Peak: 2.5kHz, +3dB, Q=1.2 (more vocal presence)\n* High Shelf: 8kHz, +1.5dB, Q=0.8 (touch more air)\n\nThese preserve the speaker-like presentation while making it more familiar to conventional headphone listeners.\n\n# Comparisons\n\n**vs Sennheiser HD600:**\n\n* HD600: Traditional headphone presentation, excellent tonality\n* OAE1: Speaker-like soundstage, far better sub-bass\n* Both designed by Axel Grell but for completely different philosophies\n\n**vs Hifiman Edition XS:**\n\n* Edition XS: \"Fun\" soundstage with odd instrument placement\n* OAE1: More accurate soundstage positioning\n* Edition XS sounds more impressively \"soundstagey\" but less realistic\n\n# Final Verdict: 4/5 Stars\n\n**Why 4 stars?**\n\n* **Innovation:** Genuine attempt to solve real problems in headphone design\n* **Sound Quality:** Excellent for its intended purpose, even if unconventional\n* **Value:** Unique technology at a reasonable price\n* **Build:** Solid construction with thoughtful design\n\n**Why not 5 stars?**\n\n* **Comfort:** Hit-or-miss depending on head size\n* **Niche Appeal:** Will never be mainstream due to unconventional tuning\n* **Positioning Sensitivity:** Very sensitive to placement on head\n\n# The Bottom Line\n\nThe OAE1 isn't trying to be a better version of existing headphones. It's offering an entirely different approach to personal audio that asks you to \"think different\" about your listening experience.\n\nIf you're curious about audio science, love speakers, or want something genuinely unique in your collection, the OAE1 deserves serious consideration. Just know what you're getting into - this isn't a conventional headphone, and it never will be.\n\n**Would I recommend it?** For the right person, absolutely. For everyone? Definitely not. But that's exactly what makes it interesting. But this Is a headphone that deserves your attention as you might find you like considerable more than you might think based on the various 'reviews'.\n\n*Thanks to Grell Audio for providing the OAE1 for review. All opinions are my own after 6 weeks of extensive listening.*"

          "body": "Sennheiser IE200 with the 2nd tip position sounds absolutely incredible\nI've owned the Sennheiser IE200 for 3 years but I had never tried the 2nd tip position permitted by the dual tuning feature, because many people said it was a gimmick and unreliable. Today, out of curiosity, I decided to try it out and see if that's actually the case. This is because the 2nd position has less bass and I found the default position to have too much bass. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vv35qtx4d94f1.png?width=1235&format=png&auto=webp&s=533f39925c435262a326dd629053930ec2a3fd99\n\nI discovered that the stock tips can stay in the 2nd position reliably as long as you don't push the IEMs into your ear too hard. I used the stock silicone tips because the foam tips killed the treble and resulted in a veiled sound for me. I used the small size tips because they stayed in the 2nd position most reliably and also had the deepest fit which helped acquire the correct bass response. \n\nAfter switching to the 2nd tip position, the sound opened up massively and became a lot clearer. With the neutral bass and boosted treble, this transforms the IE200 into having a similar sound signature to the HD800S, except the IE200 has better timbre (1-2kHz is not recessed) and better bass extension. The detail, resolution, soundstage, and clarity are astonishing; it blows my HD600 and ER2XR away. Timbre on the IE200 is spot on and arguably tops my HD600 in that regard. I've never heard such *lifelike* music.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ttt5p8fcd94f1.png?width=1251&format=png&auto=webp&s=68372370921d5c67541e926a4c3747cfe68bd4b6\n\n"

          "body": "The ANC Headphone journey of a deranged audio enjoyer\n# In 2020, I was given my first pair of ANC headphones at work: the Sony WH-1000XM3. I was blown away by what Active Noise Cancellation could do on flights. Since then, I've been hunting for the perfect pair of Active Noise Cancelling headphones with my extremely nitpicky attitude, but thus far it's been a struggle.\n\nJust to preface, my home-listening needs are completely covered by my admittedly excessive wired headphone collection, so ANC headphones are something I only use on flights and in hotel rooms or alike. Here are the ANC headphones I've tried and my general thoughts on them. \n\n# Sony WH-1000XM3\n\nI really enjoyed them. The comfort was good and ANC was excellent (as a first timer). I can't remember exactly how the ANC compares to newer models, but I do recall that their passive seal worked really well with my ears. Because of that, I thought the XM4 and XM5 were actually a downgrade in ANC.\n\nI gave this pair away after work upgraded me to the XM4. So I haven’t heard them since getting invested in audio, but based on the frequency response, I have a strong feeling I’d be less positive about their sound now.\n\n# Sony WH-1000XM4\n\nThis was my first upgrade from the XM3, and I was sorely disappointed. The sound felt bassier, and to make matters worse, I had just gotten my first HD650, which shattered the illusion that bloated tuning was acceptable.\n\nI instantly regretted giving away the XM3.\n\n# Bose QC45\n\nI got these from work as well, and gave away the XM4 shortly after. With the built-in EQ, I recall getting them to sound better than the XM3/4, but the ANC had noticeable hissing and a pressure sensation. The inability to disable ANC made the hiss more of a problem than it otherwise would have been.\n\n# Sony WH-1000XM5\n\nYet another work upgrade (I was definitely spoiled by my former employer). This was the biggest letdown yet.\n\nOut was the comfort of the XM3/4. In came latex earpads and weird ANC behavior, where Sony tried to make the now-outdated ANC chip do things it just couldn’t. The “adaptive” ANC felt really weak, and any sudden sounds caused weird noise artifacts.\n\nAfter just a two-hour flight, I had red rings around my ears from the earpads trapping so much heat (not an allergic reaction, just heat related as they were fine in cooler environments). The sound was absolutely dreadful. Even with in-app EQ, I couldn’t get them to sound right (I was fairly deep into audiofoolery by this point.) The new anorexic headband padding also hurt the top of my head.\n\nAt this point, I had resigned from my previous job (not because of the XM5), so any new pairs I had to buy myself.\n\n# Focal Bathys\n\nThese were exciting. A pair of ANC headphones from a company that makes good-sounding (if not well-built) headphones? Sign me up!\n\nWith some mild EQ adjustments, I think the Bathys are still the best-sounding ANC headphones I’ve heard. But they do have their own problems.\n\nFirst, the ANC just wasn’t that good. For headphones that cost $900 (local price), they really couldn’t afford to perform so poorly in their primary use-case (realistically only use case for me). Second, there was latency. Even when wired over USB-C and 3.5mm, I noticed significant lip-sync lag when watching TV shows.\n\nEventually I also noticed the headband had a pressure point on top of my head. I thought about getting a Capra strap, but worried it wouldn’t fit in the already snug case.\n\nI reluctantly sold them after six months. I've heard the Bathys MG has better ANC, but the price increase from $900 to $1,500 feels like a spit in the face for such an incremental upgrade to the original Bathys.\n\n# AirPods Max\n\nBeing an Apple product, these weren’t really a serious consideration for me, but I got to try them from a friend. And... no.\n\nThe weight didn’t bother me at all (ZMF has toughened me up), but the lack of vertical swivel caused pressure on the bottom of my ears and jaw. The stock tuning absolutely blows (I’m an HD600 eargain enjoyer), and in classic Apple fashion, there’s no EQ in the app.\n\nANC was great, and the earpad material is my favorite of all the ones I’ve tried, but for $600 the comfort and sound were unacceptable.\n\n# Sony WH-1000XM6\n\nThese had a lot of potential. The annoying ANC behavior was gone thanks to the QN3 chip, and ANC performance is better than anything else I’ve tried. No annoying hiss or pressure sensation.\n\nThe 10-band EQ meant I could get them sounding enjoyable (not quite Bathys level, still kind of muffled overall). But the comfort completely ruined this pair for me.\n\nThe latex earpads were back. The headband padding was better than the XM5 but still not great. And now, the vertical swivel combined with the angle they rest at caused pressure on the bottom of my ears and jaw (same problem I had with the AirPods Max). I simply can’t wear these for extended flights.\n\n# Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S3\n\nBowers really did well with this one. You can tell they actually listened to user feedback from the PX8.\n\nThe tuning, while still a bit too warm for my tastes, had improved a lot. With the five-band EQ, I was able to get them sounding pleasant, almost Bathys level and certainly close enough for travels. They also look sleek and thin (unlike the bulbous XM6) and feel very sturdy.\n\nThese are by far the most comfortable pair I’ve tried. Roomy earpads, a nicely cushioned headband, their pleather is reasonably breathable (certainly more so than Sony’s latex), and a clamp that’s just right for my relatively small head.\n\nBut like the Bathys, the ANC was just not good enough. It felt like a clear step down even from older Sony models. I reluctantly (and very hesitantly, just before the return window) returned this pair. With just slightly better ANC, these would have been perfect.\n\n# Bose QuietComfort Ultra\n\nI saved this one for last. I’d seen too many reports of quality control issues (ironic that the QCs have QC issues), like squeaky hinges and channel imbalance. I also remembered the hiss from the QC45 but assumed Bose would have addressed it by now.\n\nThey hadn’t.\n\nThe QC Ultras are definitely comfortable on my head, and with a -4 (dB? steps?) to the bass EQ filter, their sound is in the acceptable range. About on par with the XM6, though not quite as good as the PX7 S3 or Bathys.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised that my unit seems free from any channel imbalance, and the hinges don't squeak or creak (though a bit grainy sounding). But the hiss is back, and it feels even louder than I remember from the QC45. Even with quiet music or silent passages, and while watching a TV show, it’s audible (like a fan in the background).\n\nIf ANC could be disabled, this wouldn’t be a big deal. On a plane, the noise floor probably masks it. But when listening quietly or watching TV in a hotel room? I also feel there is more of that ANC pressure sensation than on any other brand, I think the hiss and pressure would drive me insane in the long-run.\n\n# Well shit (Conclusion: June 2025)\n\nAt this point, I’ve come to the conclusion that there still isn’t a single pair of ANC headphones I would call truly good. Every pair has some deal-breaking issue, be it bad tuning, ANC hiss, poor ANC, or comfort issues.\n\nSo now I’m left with two options:\n\n* Just stick with the QC Ultras for flights alone, but bring wired headphones for hotel use (though it would be a bit logistically annoying to travel with two headphones)\n* Bite the ANC bullet and stick with the PX7 S3, which I like in every other way.\n\nNeedless to say, this journey has not been great."

          "body": "Modding Monolith m1060. Punching way above their price point.\nThese are some super impressive headphones. I got lucky and found them on Facebook marketplace for only $120 and I've been wanting a second pair of planars as a back up to my Hifiman Arya stealths, and I think I MIGHT like these more.\n\n\nStock sound impressions:\nWell stock, the are amazing but a little weird. These are very V shapped sounding for openbacks. They immediately sound clear and detailed, but a tad bright in some areas and light on the bass. The most notable thing I noticed was the vocals sounded very quiet or far away? Giving faux sense of sound stage. The headphone sounded weird but in the *right* ways.\n\n\nModded Sound impressions:\nI'm shocked that these could get even BETTER. I'll talk about the mods more below, but they sound drastically more boomy with a lot more bass rumble and vocals are a bit closer. I used the song [\"Snow\" by Masked Man](https://open.spotify.com/track/1ZGsWJSWXKhQ8jw4MwdsN8?si=Kvip6EZ1Ri6OajGskwxyGA) has the drop has an insane amount of sub bass rumble, and it sound great on dedicated speaker system or headphones/iems that can get low, but a lot of headphones can't capture that rumble well as it's supposed to be constant and never really disappear. Headphones like the HD600 obviously don't even capture the bass at all, let alone the rumble. After installing the fazor baffles to the back, the rumble is much more pronounced. However, I don't notice much  anywhere else. It's obviously more clear and open with the foam removal and grill swap, but the biggest change was definitely the bass, and vocals taking a small step forward.\n\n\nMods done:\n• Foam removed from back of drivers\n• pad swap with [these Hifiman ones](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSK27ZCH?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share)\n• Swapped to this [more comfortable headband](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F891MHT8?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share)\n• 3d printed [fazor baffles](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3442936) and [hex style grille](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3196741) that I hot glued pantyhose to protect the driver from lol\n\n\n\nTL;DR: These are killer headphones on a budget or if you're just willing to tinker with and tune. Bass is kinda weak stock, but better than most openbacks but can definitely be improved with the Fazor mod. That being said, I'm currently having my buddy 3d print another set of fazors to put on the inside of the ear pads, as I've read reports it does more for the sound than the outside of the cans. If you have any questions feel free to ask!"

          "body": "Audiosense T800 vs Mega5EST Bass+ vs Truthear Hexa\nSo, I'm new to this sub and just wanted to share a review of mine to anyone curious of these 3 IEMs.\n\nJust some background: I'm generally a headphones guy and have been using a HD6XX for the past 6 years or so (had a Sennheiser momentum headphone before that as a kid and a beats one that I can't remember the model of).\nThe only earbuds I've used is the Sony WF-1000xm 2,3,4 (which I actually kind of love since I'm on the road a lot and in noisy environments)\n\nMy reason for getting into IEMs is because I wanted something that I can wear for the entire day at the office without fatigue or aches in ear. So I'm going through a bunch of IEM before I stop by the audiologist and prepare to order a CIEM.\n\nSo you can say I'm pretty new to the hobby therefore I completely lack the vocabulary of audiophiles to really explain in technical terms the things I'm hearing.\n\nI've recently gotten an interest in IEMs and have now done extensive research in what potential IEMs to buy.\nBack when I didn't really have an idea of what was good I came across an article for a recommendation\n\nhttps://nobordersaudiophile.wordpress.com/2019/10/02/audiosense-t800-the-best-sub-1000-iem-i-ever-heard-deal-with-it/\n\nAnd I was like sure, why not. It's not like I have any idea what \"good\" IEMs sound like since my only frame of reference is my Sony earbuds and my HD6XX .\n\nI made my order via Audiosense website (and that was an hassle and a half given it's Chinese and their communication is very slow to say the least) and promptly forgot about them since shipping takes a couple weeks.\n\nI've ordered a pair of Truthear Hexa after watching a bunch of Crinacle, Super review, Z review, Headphone show, etc and too many online forums to count. And probably the only reason I didn't get a Zero Red is because some part of me didn't believe cheap can be good so I purchased the next step up, Hexa.\n\nAs a reminder, my reference is my HD6XX.\nMy use case is using my BTR17 via my Android phone and Apple Music.\n\nWhen I tried the hexa and daily drives them for a week, my impression of them is that they are \"good\", sound quality is comparable to the HD6XX for me so I felt generally neutral regarding these IEM. Given my minimum floor standard of sound is the HD6XX, these didn't impress me, nor annoy me so pretty good!\n\nNext I ordered a Mega5EST Bass+ and tried them out. One thing to note is these are not comfortable in my ears physically since after awhile part of my ear hurts since the fit isn't that good, the shell presses against certain parts.\nSound wise, my first impression was that it felt a bit muffled compared to the Hexa, the vocals were a bit recessed. But the more I listen to more I realized that they were better than the Hexa by like... 20%? (Arbitrary I know). The vocals on higher volumes were not fatiguing to listen to unlike how sharp they are on Hexa.\nBass I was also pretty good! Of course I don't think anything but a set of speakers will ever impress me in regards to bass, at least the sub-bass on these IEM can be felt, albeit slightly. Audio quality is on par with the HD6XX\n\nSo far it seemed my luck held with my purchases, while at the same time still not even remotely impressed despite dropping $650 on the Mega5EST which I can only describe as a HD6XX with a bit of bass (stock and no EQ).\n\nToday, my Audiosense T800 arrived in the mail and I was curious since I recalled that review I linked above. They must be absolutely fantastic right?\n\nNO, not at all. My goodness they remind me of those earbuds that came with the iPhone 1 back in the day, everything sounds like through a plastic bag or a scratchy phone call. None of it was smooth at all. I thought I was crazy, so I AB tested them against my other IEMs. If I need to actually try to tell the other ones apart, the T800 immediately stands out in how bad they are. I honestly wouldn't even be willing to spend $5 on these, not to mention the $200 I dropped ordering them.\n\nI've notified Audiosense, so hopefully I'll be able to return for full refund.\n\nMy journey continues, hopefully I can find a pair of IEM that actually blows my mind, because so far I've yet to find anything that sounds better than my HD6XX which is what I consider my \"the bare minimum of sound quality\""

          "body": "Horizon with Square Opening Pads (the effect is positive, but not what I expected)\nThe Square opening pads I ordered from Aliexpress arrived.\n\nSorry I do not have a rig to measure the differences, so this will be subjective take only. But I really did try my best by listening to particularly music with sub bass first, changing the pads, then listening to the same tracks straight after.\n\nThe stock pads are hybrid Sheepskin? outer and felt inner where it touches your head. The new Aliexpress pads are All Sheepskin with square opening. Both are sheepskin perforated on the inner inner ring.\n\nFirst tactile impression: the all Sheepskin square opening pads fit on the metal rings perfectly and feel more comfortable on the skin. Just slightly more plush and I found the stock felt inner was slightly itchy feeling sometimes. They feel slightly grippier, but not by much because of the light clamp force. I was expecting some kind of night and day difference in terms of isolation but this wasn't any different. Open back things I guess.\n\n**So my TLDR opinion:** I was expecting the all Sheepskin pads to seal better, and therefore improve the deep bass. But after listening for 30 mins on all the same music, um the bass didn't change at all at least I cannot tell any difference. Noticeable improvements to the mids highs and width though.\n\nFor example I will try to choose a song that is more popular \"London Grammar - Hey now\" when the bass comes in, it's in stages 1, 2, 3. with each stage changing in frequency, and the last one is the deepest bass. Listening carefully and judging from memory, no there is no change in bass from stock pads. I also tested by trying to simulate a better seal, or a worn in pad by pushing the pads in, but still no increase in sub bass.\n\nBut missing the layer of foam that's sewn into the stock pads, makes the Sheepskin pads sound have noticeably more detail in mids and highs. I was half expecting to make minor adjustments to the EQ after changing pads, but weirdly did not have to. It was the same natural sound signature I achieved with EQ, but with more detail. on the stock pads I was actually spending longer on setting my EQ to all other headphones I have tried and EQed, eventually reversing each adjustment and leaving it to the most natural sounding to my preference.\n\nIn the same songs by London Grammar, on stock pads I couldn't hear Hannah's voice to the fullest. But with the all Sheepskin square opening pads, I can hear every detail in her vocals. I would describe it like you are sliding your finger over some grainy unfinished wood, you are able to appreciate the details in her voice. While with stock pads, it was a bit like sliding your finger over some sanded finished wood, which still has a few lumps and bumps but overall lacks the fine detail. This was the most noticable difference and a big improvement for the Horizon.\n\nI also have the perception that there is even more space and dimension to the sound, because of this extra detail in the mids and highs. I think you would call it more accurate imaging? and a slightly wider sound stage. Although this could be just placebo because it's not a massive difference, just a slight improvement in my opinion. Which is fine because it sounded quite spacious and wide with the stock pads already.\n\nMaybe this extra width is caused by the few mm of extra thickness on the Sheepskin square opening earpad.\n\nSo yeah if I focus narrowly on the sub bass content in music that has it, I feel wanting more. But for now with the clear noticeable mids and highs improvement with the new pads, I am just enjoying listening to the music.\n\nMaybe my expectations to match bass down to 30hz like my closed back ANC headphones was too much. I like my bass to be flat and deep like Harman curve. Which is especially good for movies and electronic music, but maybe I am getting the wrong idea here on the Horizon's sound. Like the HD600 series headphones, rolled off bass does bring out more clarity in mids and highs, especially if you EQ to a darker preference like me.\n\nA few more things about Horizon I noticed:\n\n1. the swivel mechanism, is not a screw it's like a stamped rivet. I accidentally adjusted one side when I was grabbing it. While it takes some force to move, after I move it back it does feel easier to move. So I am kind of worried it will get looser and looser, making the earcup not sit flat on the side of my head. I am thinking about inserting some adhesive foam cut to the right size and shoving it in there so it can't move anymore.\n\n2. I found possibly because of the angled drivers, after putting the on everytime, shifting it back, so the opening is centered on your ear holes benefited the sound. Both in terms of width/sound stage, and detail."
