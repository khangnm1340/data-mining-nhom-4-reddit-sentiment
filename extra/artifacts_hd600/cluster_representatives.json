Today, out of curiosity, I decided to try it out and see if that's actually the case. This is because the 2nd position has less bass and I found the default position to have too much bass. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vv35qtx4d94f1.png?width=1235&format=png&auto=webp&s=533f39925c435262a326dd629053930ec2a3fd99\n\nI discovered that the stock tips can stay in the 2nd position reliably as long as you don't push the IEMs into your ear too hard. I used the stock silicone tips because the foam tips killed the treble and resulted in a veiled sound for me. I used the small size tips because they stayed in the 2nd position most reliably and also had the deepest fit which helped acquire the correct bass response. \n\nAfter switching to the 2nd tip position, the sound opened up massively and became a lot clearer. With the neutral bass and boosted treble, this transforms the IE200 into having a similar sound signature to the HD800S, except the IE200 h"

So I got rid of it, plugged the headphone directly into my PC, and thought I was done.  Well, guess what... It's been a few months, and the left side is gone again. How the hell is this even possible?  Since this is the third time having the same issue within the warranty period, I should be able to get a refund, but I'm not sure what to do next. At this point, I really don't trust these anymore (even though I absolutely love the sound), so I was thinking about switching to something else with a similar sound profile. Would a DT 990 Pro be a suitable replacement?  "

Yes, I fell for their weeb marketing.\n\nAnyway.\n\nTo put it briefly, this is like a Japanese refinement of the legendary HD6x0. The sound signature is neutral, with forward vocals, warm and full mid-bass, and smooth, pleasant treble presentation.\n\nWith the stock (single-ended) cable, the sound has a slightly trailing / diffuse feeling similar to an HD650 paired with a tube amp. Vocals are sweet and smooth. The soundstage is airy and open, not as in-your-face as the 6x0 line, and wider than the 560S / 550 / 505. The slightly echoey bass gives an impression of a grander, more expansive stage. Even when driven by the Qudelix 5K, the T3-01-MD retains a sweet, tube-like character. This is currently my go-to portable setup when I'm away from home.  \n  \nWith Moondrop's balanced cable, the sound becomes tighter and more centered. Bass gains more punch and definition, vocal forwardness is similar to the HD600, and layering and detail separation get a boost. With good desktop amps such as Xduoo TA-32 or Topping A90/D9"

Here's some quick impressions.\n\n1. Heard the Fosi i5 first. Comfy, looks like a Susvara. At first glance the bass is pretty good. It's elevated with a good amount of body and heft. Midrange has a vocal forwardness to it which some people might like. There's a sizable midtreble peak somewhere that's fairly prominent and brings sibilance. Not intolerable for me, but pretty close to being too much. It's less intensely sharp/harsh than some of the HiFiMan peaks can be. Decent staging, feels fairly open.\n\n2. Heard the FiiO FT7 next. It's also pretty comfy. It's a much more neutral sounding set. The midrange sounds a little pulled back. No real issues with the treble, it's pretty tame though there's probably some minor peak somewhere. Bass isn't shy, but it's nothing special. Soundstage is a bit more on the intimate side. Resolution does come across as being clean, but it's not a set that I'd say is noticeably resolving. It's one of those headphones where I don't really have too much "

However, when it came to evaluating the bass, especially listening to my favorite bass drops or guitar solos, I found these headphones to be lacking. Sure, it is probably the correct and true amount of bass, but it lacked something I want to call *character*. It was so clinical and soulless with the bass, that it wiped the smile off my face caused by listening to the ethereal vocals. Taking this impression, I opened up the HD660S2.\n\nFor this one, I immediately noticed the \"warmth\" everyone referred to regarding these headphones.

I tried EQ and it didnt help, even lowest volume sounds like a glass to my ears, and while i like the soundstage and clarity of them, the good bass, they are literally unusable for me, i developed a tinnitus and pain in my ears from just few sessions with them. I paired them with fiio k7. Before that i was only ever using sennheiser iems IE200, and always found their sound perfect, i could listen to great volume with no problem.\n\nNow i want to get again an open back pair that can work for me considering my sensitivity to high frequency, i dont want them to sound muddy, but definitely warm, i want same soundstage and detail. The budget, 250 would be great, but i could go to up around 500 i think. From what i read i saw options like\n\nFiio ft1 pro\nFiio ft5\nHD600\nHD660s2\nMeze 109 pro\nAudeze lcd-2\n\nEach of these pairs cost higher than the previous one, and i dont want to pay too much for like 10% quality increase in sound. Could you give me a feedback back on these mod"

It's tuned completely differently from anything else on the market, using extreme angled drivers and \"free field\" tuning instead of traditional \"diffuse field\" approaches. After 6 weeks of extensive listening, I think it's genuinely innovative - but definitely not for everyone.\n\n# The Backstory: \"Think Different\" Meets Audio Science\n\nAfter spending many evenings listening too and thinking about the OAE1, two thoughts kept coming to mind from my computer industry background:\n\n1. **Steve Jobs' \"Think Different\" campaign**\u00a0\\- This headphone challenges conventional headphone tuning in the same way Mac challenged Windows PCs\n2. **The Gartner Hype Cycle**\u00a0\\- The OAE1's launch perfectly mirrors this: initial buzz \u2192 inflated expectations \u2192 backlash \u2192 and now, hopefully, a more balanced understanding\n\nThe truth is somewhere between the hype and the hate. Like Mac vs PC, this will always be a headphone that people either love or hate"

Note that it\u2019s not too worn in or anything.\n\nThe first 10 minutes\u2019 impression of sound is that old pads make music more dynamic. And new pads make music more dull and dry in comparison. Mind that the difference I\u2019m describing is subtle but noticeable in a back-to-back comparison setting.\n\nThe biggest difference to me was the vocal range in both male and female vocals across the genre. Vocals sound more intimate and strong and almost more dynamic in old pads. In new pads, vocals are a little far away or set back and slightly thin in comparison, which made it sound analytical and chilled down. \n\nThis difference in vocal also affected the sound stage. New pads gave me the impression of a wider sound stage, whereas in old pads, every element was more intimate. \n\nI initially expected old pads to have better bass because that\u2019s what I heard from other people and made total sense to me.

But I really did try my best by listening to particularly music with sub bass first, changing the pads, then listening to the same tracks straight after.\n\nThe stock pads are hybrid Sheepskin? outer and felt inner where it touches your head. The new Aliexpress pads are All Sheepskin with square opening. Both are sheepskin perforated on the inner inner ring.\n\nFirst tactile impression: the all Sheepskin square opening pads fit on the metal rings perfectly and feel more comfortable on the skin. Just slightly more plush and I found the stock felt inner was slightly itchy feeling sometimes. They feel slightly grippier, but not by much because of the light clamp force. I was expecting some kind of night and day difference in terms of isolation but this wasn't any different. Open back things I guess.\n\n**So my TLDR opinion:** I was expecting the all Sheepskin pads to seal better, and therefore improve the deep bass. But after listening for 30 mins on all the s"

The ELAC UniFi UBR62s were also well received at the time, but most of the reviews are several years old, so I fear it might not be competitive against the newer stuff. \n\nDemoing is not an option where I live (and used market is drier than my hands), so I'm kind of at a disadvantage on that front. I also don't have much experience with good speakers, though I have loads with headphones (my favorites are ZMF Atrium Open, HD600, HD800). \n\nI don't expect any one to come barging in with a definitive answer to which is \"better\", since I know how subjective audio is, and how room variations and listening distances can have a profound effect.
